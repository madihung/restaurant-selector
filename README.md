Dinner Decider
To end the struggles of deciding what to eat
One of the hardest parts about making plans to go out is deciding what to eat. This application is the perfect solution to end those planning problems, and can be used by anyone trying to decide where to go for a meal in the Vancouver area.

The user can view a list of restaurants the application provides and has the option of adding restaurants of their own or completely creating their own list of restaurants for the application to choose from. They then have the option of selecting a type of food they wish to eat. The application will randomly select a restaurant based on the user's selections.
